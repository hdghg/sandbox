# Mod10com - WIP

My effort to implement a BigNatural computing class
using Turbo Assembler.
BigNatural is an analogue for BigInteger, except it
does not intend to support negative numbers

# Target

Targer is a DOS executable with extension .COM
Should run successfully in dosbox

# Build

To build, run command: `DOSBUILD.BAT`
